# Day 1 of #100daysofMiva Coding Challenge
So the day of this coding challenge didn't start with any coding and before you jump into conclusions I'll tell you why. This is because I'm practically new to this Git and GitHub enevironment and well I had to take time to understand everything about Git and GitHub, its environment, commands and basically how it works and I say the learning paid off. Hopefully by tomorrow I'll actually start some real coding. 
## Thanks❤️
