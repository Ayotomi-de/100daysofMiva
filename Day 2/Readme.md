Hi guys. So for day 2 of this challenge, I decided to leave GitHub as I didn't really understand it before and focus on what I really wanted to learn: Javascript.

## What's Javascript

Imagine you‚Äôre a wizard in the world of web development. You‚Äôve got your trusty HTML to build the structure of your website, like the bones of a magical creature. Then, you have CSS to give it some style‚Äîlike choosing the perfect robe or outfit. But something‚Äôs missing. Your creation is still, lifeless. That‚Äôs where JavaScript (JS) comes in‚Äîit‚Äôs the magic wand that brings your creation to life! JavaScript is a programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It enables developers to implement features like animations, form validations, and real-time updates without needing to reload the page. JavaScript can be used on both the front end (what users see and interact with) and the back end (server-side operations) of web applications.

JavaScript is everywhere. It‚Äôs the language that makes the web what it is today‚Äîinteractive, fun, and endlessly engaging. Whether you‚Äôre looking to create a cool website, an addictive mobile app, or even a game, learning JavaScript is like learning the most powerful spell in the book.

## Uses of Javascript

JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language widely used in web development. Here are some key uses of JavaScript:

1. Web Development (Frontend)
Interactive Web Pages: JavaScript makes websites interactive. From dropdown menus to image sliders, it powers the dynamic elements you see on a website.
Form Validation: It checks if the user has filled out a form correctly before submitting it.
Animations: JavaScript can create animations and effects, such as fading elements or moving objects on the screen.
2. Web Development (Backend)
Server-Side Programming: With Node.js, JavaScript can run on the server to handle requests, manage databases, and serve content.
Real-time Applications: JavaScript is used for real-time applications like chat apps, online gaming, and live data streaming.
3. Mobile App Development
Cross-Platform Mobile Apps: Frameworks like React Native and Ionic use JavaScript to build mobile apps that work on both iOS and Android.
4. Game Development
Browser Games: JavaScript, along with HTML5 and Canvas, is used to create interactive games that run directly in the browser.
5. Automation and Scripting
Task Automation: JavaScript can automate repetitive tasks in web development, such as minifying files or testing code.
Browser Extensions: JavaScript powers many browser extensions that enhance the functionality of browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
6. Data Visualization
Charts and Graphs: Libraries like D3.js and Chart.js allow developers to create complex data visualizations and interactive charts.
7. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
AI and ML Models: JavaScript, with libraries like TensorFlow.js, can be used to build and run AI models directly in the browser.
8. Internet of Things (IoT)
IoT Devices: JavaScript can be used to program IoT devices, enabling communication between devices and the web.
9. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
PWAs: JavaScript enables the development of web apps that work offline and feel like native mobile apps.
10. API Integration
Fetching Data: JavaScript is used to interact with APIs, fetching data from servers and displaying it on web pages dynamically.

These are just a few of the many uses of JavaScript, which continues to be a key language in the tech industry due to its flexibility and wide range of applications.

## What I did today on Javascript

So basically, I didn't go head on and start codes I didn't understandüòÇ. I took it step by step. I first learnt how to code on the chrome development tool and I'll like to show you how I did that.

## HOW TO OPEN THE CHROME DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

There are 3 ways to open the chrome development tools:
-Command+Alt+J on Mac
Control + Alt+ J on Windows
-Right clicking the mouse and then choosing inspect will also open the devlopment tool on Chrome. Although it will bring up the element tab and we can then go to console which is where we are going to carry out some codes.
-The last step is to go to the chrome menu and then go to view, click on developer. Under the developer click on Javascript console and the console tab will pop up.
The one that worked for me is the second one where I just right clicked on my mouse and clicked on inspect and then navigated to console tab.
NB: I used the guest browser and not my normal browser.
I can increase the font by clicking on command plus and then vice versa by clicking on command - in mac but in chrome it‚Äôs control + and control -.

The console allows us to write and test Javascript code so it‚Äôs very useful during development e.g fixing errors however we can‚Äôt write real applications using this console.

`alert("Hello World")
let js = "amazing"
if (js === 'amazing') alert("Javascript is fun")
50+60-10`


## Challenges I faced

The only challenge I can say I faced was not knowing why the codes where working that way and with time I believe I'll understand and be very good at it.

## Conclusion

I'm very happy that I took this journey and that I'm already learning a lot. I personally know that I'll soon overcome the challenges I faced and before you know it I'll be a guruü§≠. Anyways thanks a lot fam‚ù§Ô∏è. Anticipate my day 3 articleüëãüèæ.
